# Arrays In Java
~~~~
=> The simple array in java cannot be used dynamically. For example. we have int[] array = new Int[5]; this array can store only 5 elements, its size cannot be changed in the future.
=> If you want an array which can be used dynamically you can use ArrayList in Java or
=> In this section we will build our own dynamic array data structure which will have methods like get, push, replace, pop, delete, length.
